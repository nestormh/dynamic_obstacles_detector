dynamic_obstacles_detector (Project discontinued, not working)
==============================================================

This nodelet is able to detect differences in a point cloud between frames, obtaining which points correspond to dynamic obstacles and which to static ones.

This is just an skeleton for a project I started some time ago but never continued. At this point, it just receives a point cloud and sends a message. Do not waste your time! :)
